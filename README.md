# Crawler
Crawler is my first game I set out to make entirely in 30 days.  
It is a 2D top down dungeon game made in C on windows using no external libraries.    

## How to compile
Clone the git repo using `git clone https://github.com/nickel-dev/crawler.git`.  
The go into the directory you just clone `cd crawler`.  
After that you can just run `build.bat` which will build and run the game.    

!!! Make sure you run build.bat in a [MSVC Command Prompt](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/command-prompt-powershell?view=vs-2022) or the compiler will not be available !!!
